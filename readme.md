max patch for [faderfox uc3](http://www.faderfox.de/uc3.html) controller

Install as a package then use object [uc3 re] or [uc3 ab] for relative encoder setup or absolute encoder setup.

You need my special setup to use this patch.

misc/re.midi: the controller setup for uc3, playback into uc3 to "flash" the setup to uc3.
